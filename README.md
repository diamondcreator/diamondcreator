<h3 align="center">A passionate fullstack engineer</h3>

I'm a master's degree in Computer Science, and I currently work as a fullstack developer but I'm dedicating myself to specializing in frontend. So here you can see some personal projects, know what I'm studying and even get some code tips if you're starting your journey.

Currently I dedicate myself to Node.js and Deno (with Typescript and Javascript), React.js, React Native. I study every day and I am focused 100% on the goal of evolving my development career.

In my spare time, I enjoy sports, music and nature, pursuing dreams with a passion for the future.

Learning is my most important hobby.

I especially like fishing, chess and golf, and I also participate in teamwork like soccer and take the time to try new things. As a Music, I like the symphonies of Mozart and Beethoven. I also like popular songs.

Everyone will love diamonds, because they are precious. To be loved by clients with precious skills and credit, this's my passion and mission.

Thanks for visiting my profile and feel free to contact me if you wish!
